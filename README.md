# Arduino Projects

This repository contains a collection of Arduino projects that I have created as I learn to use the tool.

## Contents

-   `readPotentiometer`: A project that reads the analog input from a potentiometer.
-   `trafficLight`: A project that simulates a traffic light using three LEDs (red, yellow, and green).

## Getting Started

Each project is stored in its own folder and contains an `.ino` file that can be opened and uploaded to an Arduino board.
I recommend using the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
